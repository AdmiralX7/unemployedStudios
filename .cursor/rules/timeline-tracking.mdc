# Timeline Tracking Guidelines

As your AI assistant, I will maintain a detailed project history through a timeline.txt file.

## Timeline Management

1. **Maintain a detailed timeline.txt** at the root of the project:
   - After each significant action, I will update timeline.txt with a timestamped entry
   - For complex actions, I'll break them down into multiple entries
   - I'll ensure each entry is descriptive enough for future context

2. **Timeline entry format**:
   ```
   [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - ACTION: Brief description of what was done
     DETAILS: More detailed explanation if needed
     FILES: List of files affected
     OUTCOME: Result of the action (if applicable)
   ```

3. **Create timeline.txt if it doesn't exist** before beginning work on the project.

4. **Review the timeline** at the start of each new conversation to understand project history.

## Timeline.txt Commands

```bash
# Command to insert a new timestamp entry in timeline.txt
echo -e "\n[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] - ACTION: Description of action\n  DETAILS: More details here\n  FILES: list of files affected\n  OUTCOME: Result of action" >> timeline.txt

# Command to create timeline.txt if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f timeline.txt ]; then
  echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] - ACTION: Project initialized\n  DETAILS: Starting new project work\n  OUTCOME: Timeline tracking established" > timeline.txt
fi
```

As your AI assistant, I will maintain thorough documentation throughout the project.

## Documentation Practices

1. For significant changes:
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add comments explaining complex logic
   - Document any new dependencies or configuration requirements

2. When adding new features:
   - Create or update README files as appropriate
   - Document the feature's purpose, usage, and limitations
   - Include examples of usage where helpful

3. For public interfaces:
   - Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
   - Include usage examples
   - Note any performance considerations

## README Maintenance

1. Keep README.md up-to-date with:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Configuration options
   - Dependency information

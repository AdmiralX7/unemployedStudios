# Game Development Flow Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture for our game development flow using CrewAI. This flow orchestrates multiple specialized crews to create a complete HTML5 game.

## Execution Strategy

This flow uses a mix of sequential and parallel execution patterns:
1. **Sequential Phases**: Each major phase must complete before the next begins
2. **Parallel Execution**: Within the Code Generation and Asset Generation phases, crews operate in parallel
3. **Synchronization Points**: Integration Checkpoint and Asset Integration synchronize parallel work
4. **Feedback Loops**: Allow for iterative refinement based on validation results

## Dedicated Crews for Core Files

### 1. Engine Crew
**Purpose**: Develop the core game loop, rendering pipeline, and input handling
**Core File**: `game_engine.js`

## Core File Strategy

Each dedicated crew is responsible for generating and maintaining a specific core file:

1. **game_engine.js** (Engine Crew) - Core game loop, rendering, input handling
   - Game initialization and setup
   - Main game loop logic
   - Rendering pipeline
   - Input handling system
   - Time management

2. **game_entities.js** (Entity System Crew) - Game objects and entities
   - Entity base classes
   - Component system
   - Entity factory
   - Collision detection
   - Physics and movement

3. **game_levels.js** (Level System Crew) - Level definitions and loading
   - Level data structures
   - Level loading and unloading
   - Progression system
   - Objective management
   - Enemy placement

4. **game_ui.js** (UI System Crew) - UI components and screens
   - UI component framework
   - Screen management
   - HUD elements
   - Menu systems
   - Responsive layout

5. **game_assets.js** (Asset System Crew) - Asset loading and management
   - Asset loading pipeline
   - Resource management
   - Asset caching
   - Image processing helpers
   - Preloading system

6. **game_audio.js** (Audio System Crew) - Audio system and sound effects
   - Audio engine initialization
   - Sound effect playback
   - Music system
   - Volume controls
   - Audio event system

## State Management

The flow maintains comprehensive state across all phases, tracking:
- Game concept details and GDD
- Technical design specifications
- Interface contracts between systems
- Generated code for each core file
- Asset references and metadata
- Testing results
- Error reports and remediation status

## Parallel Execution with `and_` Function

The flow leverages CrewAI's parallel execution capabilities using the `and_` function:

```python
# Example of parallel execution in Code Generation Phase
@listen(technical_design_completion)
def initiate_code_generation(self):
    # Start all code generation crews in parallel
    self.engine_crew_generation()
    self.entity_crew_generation()
    self.level_crew_generation()
    self.ui_crew_generation()
    self.asset_crew_generation()
    self.audio_crew_generation()

@listen(and_(engine_crew_generation, entity_crew_generation, level_crew_generation, 
          ui_crew_generation, asset_crew_generation, audio_crew_generation))
def integration_checkpoint(self):
    # This runs only after ALL code generation crews have completed
    # Validate that all systems work together
```

## Routing with Conditional Logic

The flow uses the `@router()` decorator to implement feedback loops:

```python
@router()
def evaluate_integration(self):
    """Route based on integration test results"""
    if self.state.integration_issues:
        return self.remediate_code_issues
    else:
        return self.proceed_to_asset_generation
```

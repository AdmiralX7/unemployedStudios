/**
 * Integration Notes:
 * - This file can be included directly in an HTML page where you want standalone functionality.
 * - For existing template-based integration, refer to specific extension points marked in the
 *   original template provided code. This standalone approach gives a way to test or provide
 *   compatibility without altering the primary architecture.
 * - Use of serialize and deserialize functions offers convenience for saving game state
 *   in browser storage or server-side solutions.
 * - While the logic and methods detailed here provide a robust start, customization is encouraged
 *   to align with game-specific designs and requirements.
 *
 * Usage:
 * <script src="path/to/game_levels.js"></script>
 * Ensure that `game_levels.js` is loaded after your game initialization scripts if it's meant for integration.

This `game_levels.js` file stands as a standalone JavaScript file to provide functionality related to level systems independently or as a reference for integrating into an existing framework. It includes crucial fallback and utility features such as level data management and transition methods, facilitating both backward compatibility and standalone operability.

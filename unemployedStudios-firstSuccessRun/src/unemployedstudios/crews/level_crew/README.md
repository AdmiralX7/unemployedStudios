# Level System Crew

This crew handles the level system development phase of game development, implementing a key component of the Game Development Flow Architecture.

## Purpose

The Level System Crew is responsible for:

1. **Level System Development** - Creating the core system for level definition, loading, and rendering
2. **Map Generation** - Implementing systems for representing and managing level maps and elements
3. **Progression System** - Developing player advancement tracking and level unlocking
4. **Challenge Balancing** - Implementing difficulty progression and gameplay balancing

## Usage

To use the Level System Crew in your flow:

```python
from unemployedstudios.crews.level_crew import LevelCrew

# In your flow
@listen(technical_design_phase)
def level_crew_generation(self):
    """Run the level system development phase of game development"""
    level_output = (
        LevelCrew()
        .crew()
        .kickoff(inputs={
            "core_systems_design": self.state.core_systems_design,
            "component_interfaces": self.state.component_interfaces,
            "concept_expansion": self.state.concept_expansion  # Contains level information
        })
    )
    
    # Store the output in the flow state
    self.state.game_levels_file = level_output.final_integration_task
```

## Output Files

The crew generates the following output file:

- `GameGenerationOutput/game_levels.js` - The level system implementing level loading, map generation, progression tracking, and challenge balancing

## Agents

The crew consists of four specialized agents:

1. **Level Design Architect** - Designs and implements the core level system
2. **Map Generator** - Creates systems for level representation and map management
3. **Progress System Developer** - Implements player progression tracking
4. **Challenge Balancing Expert** - Develops difficulty progression systems

## Required Inputs

The recommended inputs are:
- `core_systems_design` - Specifications for level systems from the Technical Design Phase
- `component_interfaces` - Interface definitions for level loading interfaces
- `concept_expansion` - Information about levels from the Concept Phase

## Next Steps

After the Level System Crew completes its work, the `game_levels.js` file serves as a key component in the Code Generation Phase of the Game Development Flow. The level system works with the game engine and entity system to create, load, and manage game levels and player progression.

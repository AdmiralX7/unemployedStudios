A0: Create Your First Game


Objective: Work in groups to design and create your first game. This assignment encourages creativity, collaboration, and technical application in AI-powered game development.


Step 1: Choose a Genre
Select a genre from the provided list or propose your own. Some popular options with sample games listed here. 
You are HIGHLY encouraged to create entirely new game genres, for example by fusing 2 game genres together: 
Example: A mashup of card games (solitaire), poker, and roguelikes: Balatro 


Step 2: Form a Group:


* Groups should consist of 2 -- 4  members
* Use Discord server for group formation, find other students with common interest in game genre who are able to complement your skills and expertise 




Step 3: Game Development


Use tools like ChatGPT or your choice of large language models (LLMs) to:


* Brainstorm game ideas.
* Generate storylines, dialogues, or scripts.
* Write code snippets.
* Create visual or thematic elements.
* Develop the game for the HTML5 platform.




Step 4: Submission Deliverables


* A playable prototype of the game (HTML files, sounds/*.wav, images/*.png | jpg, etc.) as a ZIP file 
* Video demo of game in action 
* A one-page description of your game, including:
   * Group members: Names and netids 
   * Game genre selection
   * Instructions on how to play 
   * Novel features and mechanics 
   * Class goals: How will you incrementally build on top of this game genre during this semester ? What novel feature or game mechanic will you develop ? How will you push the boundaries of generative AI ? Will you focus on depth (single, sophisticated game) or breadth (variety of games) ?
